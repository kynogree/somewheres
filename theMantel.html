	<p> I felt like that when I stopped being able to see them as often </p>
	<p> When I was surrounded by young gays</p>
<p> In as fucked situations as we were</p>
<p> As I still was</p>
<p> And still am</p>
<p> And I’m not sure what to do </p>
<p> Even when they look up to me</p>
<p> They don’t realize I’m looking up straight back at them</p>
<p> Because my mothers were probably looking straight at me too</p>
<p> and I didn’t know</p>
<p> The playing fields had always been even</p>
	
<br>
<p>No one knows what to do when their rotting hands find their way into your brain</p>
<p>And begins to squeeze</p>
<p>The real-world creeps in</p>
<p>And the men start coming</p>
<p>And tell you it’s only because you look older </p>
<p>So, they must have permission</p>
<p>Because if you were older, it’d be fine</p>
<p>And the women who love them rally to their defense</p>
<p>And poke holes in your body with the smallest sharpest of knives</p>
<p>Because they’re more worried about you stealing him </p>
<p>Than what he’ll do to them</p>
<br>

<p>And it happens in somewhere and it happens outside of somewhere</p>
<p>And your heart breaks because some strange woman did it too</p>
<p>And you find yourself walking on train tracks </p>
<p>And throwing rocks at the graffiti </p>
<p>And picking up boulders</p>
<p>And rusted parts</p>
<p>With the queers that raised you</p>
<p>Because they were the last people to treat you like the child you were</p>
<p>Who didn’t tell you it was time to drop the comics and grow up</p>
<p>Who didn’t compare their boobs to yours even though they raised you</p>
<p>And who didn’t try to get you to fuck a 20 year old</p>
<p>At 16</p>
<p>Who are the only people who you can seem to remember </p>
<p>who were of age</p>
<p>And didn’t want to fuck you</p>
<br>

<p>Because you can walk through empty fields with your step siblings</p>
<p>To trailers that served the ice cream</p>
<p>That became a town delicacy</p>
<p>Because you can run in the dimming airless gym</p>
<p>And smell the sneaker</p>
<p>That hit the pavement</p>
<p>And cover your whole body with the uniforms</p>
<p>Because you can go to the conventions </p>
<p>And put on your best disguises</p>
<p>Because you can go to the playground</p>
<p>Because you can take a shower</p>
<p>Because you can go home</p>
<p>And it'll still seep in there</p>
<p>Because if they’re not grabbing you </p>
<p>They’re blaming you</p>
<p>Because no matter how careful you are</p>
<p>They’ll find you when you’re completely <a href="bitterSweet.html">defenseless</a></p>
