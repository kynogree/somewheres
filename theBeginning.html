	<p>I’m young. I’m gay. And I live 20 minutes outside somewhere.</p>
<p>I set the girls I’m in love with up with each other</p>
<p>Because I’m too broken to think about my love for them in anyway but sex.</p>
<p>I tell boys I like I’m not ready to hold their hand</p>
<p>Because I’m scared that when they touch me it’ll hurt.</p>
<p>The boys I love turn into girls</p>
<p>Because they were girls the whole time</p>
	
<br>

<p>I live in cosplay</p>
<p>Sewing and hot gluing my disguise</p>
<p>When I’m not annoying my teachers</p>
<p>Or being tortured by my peers at school</p>
<p>Or with the kids who raised me</p>
<p>My father and I walk around the desolate streets </p>
<p>And i stare at the untouched bits of forest</p>
<p>The tall stocks of corn</p>
<p>And the empty fields set to become subdivisions</p>
<p>When someone gets around to it</p>

<br>
	
<p>The kids who raised me are all 3 years older than me</p>
<p>And I’ve known some of them my whole life</p>
<p>And I’ve only met others because one took a chance on me</p>
<p>And saw a broken kid with drawings on her arm</p>
<p>And turned her into a friend</p>

	<br>
	
<p>Some girl in my German class discovers who I am </p>
<p>Before any of the kids who raised me</p>
<p>The queers who raised me</p>
<p>Because I trusted the wrong person</p> 
<p>And they aren’t sure they believe me at first</p>
<p>But they take me places</p>
<p>And they hold my hand</p>
<p>And they don’t touch me anywhere else because even though I’m old for my age </p>
<p>I’m still too young</p>
<p>And they drive home from college in somewhere and tell me about all the art they’ve been making</p>
<p>While my sophomore eyes stare wide at breathing faces staring back at me from the page</p>

<br>
	
<p>They were my moms</p>
<p>Even though like my parents they’re no longer together</p>
<p>When I walked into one of their bedrooms, I was home </p>
<p>Because I could see the books on her shelves</p>
<p>Which lined the walls</p>
<p>And the posters she had to tape to her ceiling</p>
<p>Because the books and figures and wigs took up too much space</p>
<p>And I never slept with her despite what the fucking wench would tell you</p>

<br>
	
<p>My other mom came to my bedroom and played the ukulele</p>
<p>Because the fucking wench went to go get laid</p>
<p>And my father wasn’t sober enough to come home</p>
<p>Even though she didn’t know me</p>
<p>She took out my sketchbook </p>
<p>That my first mom gave me</p>
<p>And drew pictures to make me laugh</p>
<p>And I heated an oven pizza</p>
<p>In the freezing fall kitchen</p>

	<br>
<p>Even though they teach me</p>
<p>About art </p>
<p>And love</p>
<p>And about keeping secrets</p>
<p>To keep yourself safe</p>
<p>It can’t stop anything that’s coming</p>
<p>Because they were just old enough to know a little </p>
<p>But not enough</p>
<p>And I wasn’t old <a href="theMantel.html">enough</a> to know anything</p>
