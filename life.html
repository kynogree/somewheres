<p>You’re 20 minutes outside somewhere</p>
<p>They’ll take you anywhere in their car</p>
<p>Even if it’s the town over</p>
<p>They’ll treat you to japanese candy </p>
<p>And lesbian music</p>
<p>Holding you in their arms when the real one</p>
<p>decides she doesn’t want you</p>
<p>And you thought the person who was the closest to being a brother to you</p>
<p>Who showed you everything you ever fell in love with</p>
<p>Will be the closest thing you get to an older sister</p>
<p>She’ll drive you around too</p>
<p>You both will talk in languages no one else will understand</p>
<p>Not in somewhere</p>
<p>Or 10 minutes outside it</p>
<p>Or 30</p>
<p>Just 20 minutes</p>
<br>
<p>You sit with them at the most amazing concerts</p>
<p>Singing the words to songs you’ve never heard before</p>
<p>You’ll all get sushi </p>
<p>And watch studio ghibli </p>
<p>And draw </p>
<p>And draw </p>
<p>And draw</p>
<p>And scream at the top of your lungs</p>
<p>In places no one can hear</p>
<p>Because honestly without a car there's not much to do </p>
<p>20 minutes outside of <a href="somewheres.html">somewhere</a></p>
